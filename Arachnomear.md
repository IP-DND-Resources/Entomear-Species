# Arachnomear

Arachnomear are typically solitary creatures that are very mindful of other creatures, preferring dark areas and deep swamps as opposed to large cities, and well traveled roads. They don't hate other species, but are extremely cautious of unfamiliar people and situations. It is difficult for other species to distinguish between male or female arachnomear, but females tend to express more dominant and typically masculine traits, though this is not true of all arachnomears.

Arachnomear have 6 arms, 2 that are full sized and 4 that are smaller and normally stay idle. The smaller arms can be used in some limited ways. Arachnomear generally have dark colored exoskeletons, which are not easily broken. They have multiple eyes, ranging from 4-8. They are often covered in hairs and have large chelicerae or pincers, and typically have a large bulky body.

### Arachnomear Traits

**Creature Type:** Humanoid  
**Size:** Medium (about 4-5 feet tall) or Small (about 2-4 feet tall), chosen when you select this species.  
**Speed:** 30 feet  
:
As an Arachnomear, you have these special traits.  

**Arachnid Limbs** You have a Climb Speed equal to your Speed. You can use your Climb Speed to move in any direction on vertical surfaces and ceilings. You must use 4 of your limbs (legs and arms) to remain attached to any surface you are climbing while not moving. 

You gain Advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to climb any surface.

You are considered to have an additional limb for the purpose of climbing or holding a tiny object. This increases to two limbs once you reach character level 5.

**Creep:** You have proficiency in the Stealth skill. When you reach character level 3, you gain the ability to hide more effectively while climbing. While you are Climbing, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to avoid detection.

**Many Eyes:** You gain a +1 bonus to Initiative rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at level 7.

**Careful Step:** You gain the ability move through Webs as though they weren't difficult terrain. You always succeed saving throws to avoid the Restrained condition from Webs.

**Web Throw:** As a Bonus action, you can cast the Web spell without components or expending a spell slot. Its range is reduced to self, its size is reduced to a 10 foot cube, and it does not require concentration to maintain. You can use this trait a number of times equal to half of your proficiency bonus (rounded up). 

The DC for this trait is equal to 8 + your Dexterity modifier + Proficiency Bonus.

You regain 1 expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
